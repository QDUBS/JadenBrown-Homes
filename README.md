- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript Library for Building User Interfaces
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-First CSS Framework

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the frontend development server:

   ```

   The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure Explanation

- **pages:** Contains the pages of your application. For example, `index.js` represents the homepage, and `property/[id].js` represents a dynamic property page.

- **components:** Reusable React components used across multiple pages. For example, `Header.js` and `PropertyCard.js`.

- **styles:** Contains global styles for Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.css`) and any other global styles (`global.css`) used throughout the application.

## Additional Configuration

- Update environmental variables, API keys, and other configurations in the relevant files (e.g., `Header.js`).
